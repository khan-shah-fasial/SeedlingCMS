                  The Directors of the company must have a digital signature

                  The DIN number must be obtained by the person who wants to be a
                  Director of a company. One DIN is enough to become a director.
                  To obtain the number, fill the SPICe+ Form with details such as
                  the name of the proposed director, PAN card, Aadhar card, and
                  address proof. A maximum of three directors can apply for DIN
                  but if the applicant wants to incorporate more than three
                  directors. Here first the company should be incorporated with
                  three directors and then appoint a new director after
                  incorporation.

                  Reserve the name through the SPICe+ form, in this two proposed
                  names can be reserved and one re-submission can be done while
                  reserving Unique Names of the Companies.

                <p class="desc" data-aos="fade-up"data-aos-once="true">
                  In case the name gets rejected due to any similarity or other
                  reason, the applicant has to refile another SPICe+ form with the
                  prescribed fees. Once the name gets approved, it will be
                  reserved for 20 days. During this time the company must proceed
                  with the incorporation process by submitting Part B of the
                  SPICe+ form.
                </p>
                <p class="desc" data-aos="fade-up"data-aos-once="true">
                  Another option for name approval is by filing Part-A and Part-B
                  of the SPICe+ Form together: The company can file the name along
                  with the application for incorporation. Part B of the SPICe+
                  enables applying for incorporation.

                  In case of rejection of the application due to non-approval of
                  the name, the applicant will get a chance to refill the same
                  SPICe+ form without any further charges. This means you get two
                  chances to change the name without paying an extra charge of Rs.
                  1000/- both times.

                <p class="desc mb-4" data-aos="fade-up"data-aos-once="true">
                  After getting the second chance, even if the name gets rejected,
                  then the applicant has to file the SPICe+ form from scratch. So,
                  this option is cheaper as compared to the first one. The whole
                  process of name approval and incorporation takes 2-3 days.
